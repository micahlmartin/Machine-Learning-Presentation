Movie Review Demo

This demo was originally given as an example in Chapter 6 of the book "Natural Language Processing with Python," by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper. 

This demo uses a corpus of movie reviews that have been classified as positive/negative to train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a new movie review is good or bad.

The code is written in Python and requires the NLTK library. NLTK can be found here: http://www.nltk.org/. It can also be obtained via MacPorts (which is the easiest way to get it if you are using a Mac). Also, you will need to download the movie_review corpus. This can easily be done using the utility that comes with nltk (if you are interested in playing more with nltk the simplest thing is to select the option to download all of the corpora used by any of the nltk book demos). As of this writing, nltk was compatible with Python 2.6.
